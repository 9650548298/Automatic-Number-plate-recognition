## ABOUT THE PROJECT
This project implements an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using Python and YOLOv8. The aim is to efficiently detect and recognize license plates from images and video streams in real-time. Leveraging the power of YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, our solution offers accurate and swift identification of vehicle license plates.

## Key Features:

Utilizes the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm for robust and real-time license plate detection.
Python-based implementation for ease of understanding, modification, and integration into various applications.

A Yolov8 pretrained model was used to detect vehicles.


## Technology Used:

Programming Language:

Python 3.x
Deep Learning Framework:

YOLOv8
A powerful and efficient real-time object detection algorithm.
Libraries and Dependencies:

OpenCV
Used for image processing and computer vision tasks.
NumPy
Essential for numerical operations and array manipulations.
